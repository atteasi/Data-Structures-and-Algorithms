  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/AV/Searching/binarySearchPRO.html

## Task 2

- In many literature, Binary search is referred to use `divide-and-conquer technique`. Discuss in groups whether you agree or disagree and justify your answers.

> You can Refer to the the following thread: [Why Binary Search is not a divide and conquer algorithm?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8850447/why-is-binary-search-a-divide-and-conquer-algorithm)

## Task 3

The file in `./src/Main.java` is for a sorted array.
